4. Creating a Laravel Project

    # Option 2
        - Using Composer to create your first Project
        - composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel THE NAME OF THE PROJECT

5. Serve the project to the web
- php artisan serve
- php artisan serve --port= ANY NUMBER YOU WANT IT TO BE

----------------------------------
Understand our directory structure
----------------------------------
App > Models === Models
Resources > Views === Views
App > Http > Controllers === Controllers

        -------------------------------------------
        1. Setting a custom domain name for testing
        -------------------------------------------
            - php artisan serve --host=ANY DOMAIN.test --port= ANY PORT YOU ARE NOT Using
            - Then add the hosts to your host file located in your etc/hosts directory
            - Add the following then to the hosts file: 127.*.*.* ANY DOMAIN.test --> ** are port numbers you can add
            - Then you run the above command again in the terminal 

        ------------------
        2. The .env file
        ------------------
        - This file is used to store the environment variables 
        - Don't use this one too much, you can use the env.example or use it as a replacement if you run into trouble.

        ----------------------------
        3. Composer json & Lock File
        ----------------------------
        - Holds the dependicies we load 
        - The vendor folder holds all the libraries we will use in our project.
        - Removing the composer.lock file (rm composer.lock) and reinstall it with composer install
        - Adding libraries into composer.json
