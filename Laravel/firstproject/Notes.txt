4. Creating a Laravel Project 
    # Option 1
        - First create the directory you want to work in from the command line
        - laravel new THE NAME OF THE PROJECT

    # Option 2
        - Using Composer to create your first Project
        - composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel THE NAME OF THE PROJECT

5. Serve the project to the web
- php artisan serve
- php artisan serve --port= ANY NUMBER YOU WANT IT TO BE

----------------------------------
Understand our directory structure
----------------------------------
App > Models === Models
Resources > Views === Views
App > Http > Controllers === Controllers

**** The structure of our application will always be in the app folder or file but the actual content will be stored on the other files such as index, about, contact us pages etc.
****

        -------------------------------------------
        1. Setting a custom domain name for testing
        -------------------------------------------
            - php artisan serve --host=ANY DOMAIN.test --port= ANY PORT YOU ARE NOT Using
            - Then add the hosts to your host file located in your etc/hosts directory
            - Add the following then to the hosts file: 127.*.*.* ANY DOMAIN.test --> ** are port numbers you can add
            - Then you run the above command again in the terminal 

        ------------------
        2. The .env file
        ------------------
        - This file is used to store the environment variables 
        - Don't use this one too much, you can use the env.example or use it as a replacement if you run into trouble.

        ----------------------------
        3. Composer json & Lock File
        ----------------------------
        - Holds the dependicies we load 
        - The vendor folder holds all the libraries we will use in our project.
        - Removing the composer.lock file (rm composer.lock) and reinstall it with composer install
        - Adding libraries into composer.json 

--------------------------
Artisan Commands
--------------------------
- php artisan make:controller (NAME OF THE CONTROLLER) ----> Creates a controller class in Laravel
- php artisan make:controller (NAME OF THE CONTROLLER) --force  -----> Will override the current controller class if it already exists

----------------------
Returning Views 
----------------------
1. Compact Method
2. With method [Best suited if you want to pass in one variable]
** Both examples are explained in the ProductsController.php file located in the Controllers folder
